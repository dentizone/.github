## ‚ú® What is Dentizone?

Dentizone is a comprehensive platform built to address the unique needs of the dental student community. Our mission is to provide a trusted, secure, and user-friendly marketplace where students can buy and sell new or used dental supplies and equipment. The entire ecosystem is built on a foundation of trust, with features like mandatory KYC (Know Your Customer) verification to ensure a safe environment for all users.

The Dentizone platform is composed of several interconnected projects, each housed in its own repository. Together, they form a robust, scalable, and feature-rich application suite.

Each repository contains a detailed `README.md` with specific instructions for setup, installation, and local development. To get the entire ecosystem running, you will generally need:

1.  A running instance of the **Backend API** ([dentizone/api](https://github.com/dentizone/api)).
2.  A running instance of the **AI Service** ([dentizone/ai](https://github.com/dentizone/ai)).
3.  The **User Frontend** ([dentizone/user-frontend](https://github.com/dentizone/user-frontend)) configured to point to the API.
